// Problem || Leetcode : 221
/*
    -> Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's.
    -> Find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
*/

// Solution
/*  
    # Method 1 : Recursion (TLE)
    -> For this we need to think shallow, don't go too deep.
    -> We solve one case, rest is handled by recursion.
    
    -> For every direction we check in three directions to check for square recursively.
    -> 3 directions:
        - Right
        - Diagonal
        - Bottom.
    -> As we start from the first position we move to these three positions. (First position is our that 'one case' which we solve in recursion).
    -> Now, we get the minimum of answers from all 3 positions to make a square.
    
    -> And then we save that answer in the result (which stores maximum of all answers).
