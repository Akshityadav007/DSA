// Problem
/*

    -> You are given an array consisting of n integers which denote the position of a stall. 
    -> You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
    -> You are given the task of assigning stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

*/

/*
    -> Approach is similar to book allocation.
    
    -> We need to find maximum possible distance to keep the cows away from each other.
    -> There will be multiple permutations to keep the cows at different positions (on number line).
    -> Also as the positions should be increasing as the cows need to be put on stalls number wise, the array should be sorted.
    -> The maximum distance between '2' cows can be between 'first' and 'last' stall, i.e. 'highest number' of the array to 'lowest number' of the array.
    -> âˆ´ Search space in this problem will be from 0 to (highest number - lowest number).

    -> We'll apply binary search and for every mid we'll check if it is a possible solution.
    ->  Case 1: Possible Solution:
                - Store the mid as answer (because mid is the distance in this permutation.)
                - Move right - because we need to get maximum possible distance between them.
        Case 2: Not possible Solution:
                - Move left - mid (distance) was too high and the cows couldn't be placed on the limited stalls.

    -> While checking for possible solution:
        - First place the first cow at first position.
        - Keep track of the last cow placed.
        - Keep checking the distance between the current stall and last placed cow's position (kept track), check if it exceeds the maximum possible distance (mid) chosen this time.
        - If it exceeds or is equal to maximum distance (mid) chosen, we need to place the current cow here and keep track of this position and move ahead.
        - Before moving to the next position, check if all cows have been placed already (keep track of this too).
        - If all cows have been placed return true, as it is a possible solution.
        - If were not able to place all cows in the stalls, i.e. basically we ran out of stalls, return false as this isn't a possible distance to be taken.
