    A nearly sorted array is an array in which, element at 'i' in sorted array is found at i - 1,i,i + 1.
    
    -> So we'll simply keep checking mid - 1 and mid + 1 positions too while checking for mid.
    -> Also since we already have checked for mid - 1 and mid + 1 positions, while updating low/high we'll update it by +/- 2 instead of +/- 1. (actually this improves the code, had we used earlier version too, would have worked)
    -> We need to handled out of bound condtions also (index = -1,-2 or index = n, n + 1)
