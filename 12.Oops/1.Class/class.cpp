    -> Access modifiers -   They define scope of access.
        1) Public: - All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone. 
                   - The data members and member functions declared as public can be accessed by other classes and functions too. 
                   - The public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program using the direct member access operator (.) with the object of that class. 

        2) Private: - The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. 
                    - They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class. 
                    - Only the member functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private data members of the class. 

        3) Protected: - The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class. 
                      - The difference is that the class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well. 
                      - #Note : This access through inheritance can alter the access modifier of the elements of base class in derived class depending on the mode of Inheritance.

    -> Constructor : 
        - It constructs an instance of class.
        - Used to take input while making the object of the class. 
        - It is the only function which has no return type (not even void).
        - It is public.
        - Syntax:
            // default constructor
            class_name(){

            }

    -> Polymorphism :same function many forms
        - This is shown in below 'Student' class having multiple constructors.
    
    -> In C++, there is a hidden pointer 'this' added by compiler privately. (class_name *this)

    -> We use ' . ' to access methods of class stored on stack.
    -> We use ' -> ' to access methods of class stored on heap.(We can also use de - referencing operator i.e. (*obj_name).method_name)
    -> In case of heap memory allocation, make sure to delete() to check memory leak.
