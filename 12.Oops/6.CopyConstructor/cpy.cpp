/*   ------------------
    | COPY Constructor |
     ------------------

    1. Copy Constructors are used to copy one object to another.
    2. It is not necessary to create copy object (compiler will add it), but it is always a good practice to have them.

    Ques. Why do we need a COPY constructor ?
    Ans. -> This is used in ' Deep copying '.
    
    3. In parameter of COPY constructor, it is necessary to pass by value because if not done so, it will make a copy of the object.
       And we haven't yet created the COPY constructor, hence this is wrong!
    4. Also it is declared 'const', so that it's values aren't changed by intruders (hackers).
