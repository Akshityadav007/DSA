Pillars of oops:

1. Abstraction  -  Hiding data what others/users should not know.
2. Encapsulation - Often a means to achieve abstraction by hiding details.
                 - Perfect Encapsulation: All data members are private. (Use getter/setter)
4. Inheritance  - Explained in cpp file.
4. Polymorphism - Existing in many forms. (Explained in cpp file.)
